### (question 1 on hw)

Continuous probability simulation: the logarithms of weights (in pounds) of men
in the United States are approximately normally distributed with mean 5.13
and standard deviation 0.17; women with mean 4.96 and standard deviation
0.20. Suppose 10 adults selected at random step on an elevator with a capacity
of 1750 pounds. What is the probability that the elevator cable breaks?
