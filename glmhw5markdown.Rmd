# Question 1:

According to the textbook, 52% of the United States is female. So, we will run our simulation using this proportion. 

```{r}

### Choose our number of simulations:
n.sims = 1000000

### Initiate a results vector:
totalweight = c()


### Run simulation using a for loop:

set.seed(100)

for (i in 1:n.sims) {
  
  sex = rbinom(10, 1, .52) ### Determines gender of the ten people (1 = Female)
  
  weight = ifelse(sex == 1, 
                  rnorm(1, mean = 4.96, sd = .2), ### Weight distribution for female 
                  rnorm(1, mean = 5.13, sd = .17)) ### Weight distribution for male
  
  result = sum(exp(weight)) ### Get weight in pounds by exponentiating and add them all together
  
  totalweight[i] = result ### Tally our simulation results
  
}

breaks = sum(totalweight >1750) ### Count the number of cases where the elevator breaks

breaks / n.sims ### Probability of failure 

```

After simulating a million times, we find that the probability that the elevator breaks is .21.
